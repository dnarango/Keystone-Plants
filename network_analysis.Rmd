## First, you need metric function from suave
## The smaller the metric, the more resilient the network is

First you need to calculate initial stability
Then you need to calculate stability with plants removed

First I need to important the interaction network for a county. Here we use a simple 0,1 network of host plant use

```{r}
##For montana

#libraries
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)


## All montana plants for each county
mt_plants<-read.csv("C:/Users/dnarango/Desktop/Kimberley LEPS/montana_plants.csv", na.strings=".") %>%
  transform(MT_counties=str_split(MT_counties, ",")) %>%
    unnest(MT_counties)

##All montana leps for Jefferson county
### Need to determine how to treat the weird genera
mt_leps<-read.csv("C:/Users/dnarango/Desktop/Kimberley LEPS/jeffersonMT_leps.csv", na.strings=c("", "NA",".")) %>%

Example of a food web, using the community stability index as in Sauve et al. 2016 Ecology
.......................................................................................................
The community stability index represent the minimum intraspecific competition for the system to be stable (the smaller the more stable)
This community stability index can be used if there is no cannibalism (only zero on the diagonal of the adjacency matrix)
If there are some of these interactions, use directly the resilience as index of stability 
(= real part of the dominant eigenvalue of the jacobian matrix): the more negative, the more resilient

Analysis steps: 
Step 1: Calculate the change in structural stability with the removal of each interaction separately
Step 2: Calculate the number of extinctions following the removal of each interaction separately

#... Load the adjacency matrix
# the adjacency matrix m is a square matrix of size S, with S the total number of species
# undirected interactions (or bidirectional) are such that m_ij = m_ji = 1
# directected interactions (such as antagonistic ones) are such that m_ij = 1 and m_ji = 0 if i feeds on j (j -> i)
# i are the rows, with species in their role of consumer in antagonistic interactions
# j are the columns, with species in their role of resource in antagonistic interactions

#Step 1:  Change in structural stability with the removal of each interaction
